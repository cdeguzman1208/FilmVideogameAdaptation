Your final game is graded based upon the following criteria

**STRUCTURE**

+10 The game is playable without critical errors or crashes or without major areas of procedural confusion.

+10 The game includes a title screen/box/titlepage, a credits section, and an "ending." (These criteria are judged relative to your specific game, genre, artistic tone, etc.)

+10 The player can learn the controls or instructions from within the game, whether through a tutorial, instruction screen, instruction book, script, or other diegetic means.

+10 The game is playable to completion by a player of moderate skill. If your game is purposefully difficult and you're concerned that the grader won't be able to evaluate it properly, please provide a "grader mode" or other accommodation that will allow us to see everything you've made.

**DESIGN**

+25 Your game has artistic cohesion, i.e. the art, sound, typography, writing, materials etc. reflect your stated aesthetic/experience goals, and your assets make sense together.

+25 Your game has mechanical cohesion, i.e. the mechanics reflect your stated aesthetic/experience goals, the game feels good to play, and the mechanics are well-implemented.

**EXCELLENCE**

+10 Your game has that extra bit of polish, creativity, technical/design/artistic prowess, and/or originality that helps it stand out from other games. We use this as a grade "tilt" to reward games that we really enjoyed, that are bold and inventive, that align well to the class themes, that demonstrate strong skills, and/or went beyond the stated objectives of the assignment.

**SUBMITTING:** Please submit a playable link/files so that it is playable by your TA. For physical games with unusual materials and or performance, coordinate a play-through with your TA.
