# FilmVideogameAdaptation
For Part II, you will design and program the film adaptation selected and described in Part I.

Your final game is graded based upon the following technical and aesthetic criteria, using film-based metaphor 🎥:

=== LIGHTS ===

+5 The game runs/executes without critical errors or crashes. (Graders will use Chrome, so be sure you game works in that browser.)

+5 The game includes a title screen, some means to view credits, some means of "completion," and the ability to restart from within the game. (These criteria are judged relative to your specific game, genre, artistic tone, etc.)

+5 The player can learn the game's premise and controls from within the game, whether through a tutorial, instruction screen, or other diegetic means.

+5 The game is playable to completion by a player of moderate skill. If your game is purposefully difficult and you're concerned that the grader won't be able to evaluate it properly, please provide a "grader mode" or debug menu that will allow us to see everything you've made, along with instructions for how to access that mode.

+5 Your project and code are well-structured and organized, including legible comments, appropriate data structures, sensible prefabs, meaningful variable names, logical scene structures, etc. (Nathan's examples are a good baseline.)

+5 Your project has a well-maintained and updated GitHub page that shows meaningful contributions, commits, and milestones throughout the course of the project's history.

=== CAMERA ===

+10 Your game uses at least five of Phaser's major components (besides Scenes), which may include: physics systems, cameras, particle effects, text objects, the animation manager, the tween manager, timers, tilemaps, pipeline FX, etc. (Please list these components in your main.js file.)

+10 Your game has artistic cohesion, i.e. the art, sound, typography, etc. reflect your adaptation's aesthetic goals, your game is legible as a film adaptation, and your assets make sense together.

+10 Your game has mechanical cohesion, i.e. the mechanics reflect your adaptation's technical goals, the game controls and performs as expected, and the mechanics are well-implemented.

=== ACTION ===

+5 Your game has that extra bit of polish, creativity, technical prowess, and/or originality that helps it stand out from other games. We use this criteria as a grade "tilt" to reward games that we really enjoyed, that are bold and inventive, that adapt their film thoughtfully, that demonstrate strong technical skills, and/or went beyond the stated objectives of the assignment. Feel free to add a comment to your main.js/Canvas submission if you wish to point out any features that we might miss.

=== AND...CUT! ===

If you are working as a pair, please include a comment in your main.js file/Canvas submission that includes the full name of both team members. We want to make sure both team members receive full credit.

SUBMIT
Please turn in:

a  link to your game's GitHub repository
a playable link to your game online (e.g. GitHub Pages, itch.io, etc.).
There is no grace period for this assignment.
